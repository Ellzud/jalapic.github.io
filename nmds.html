<p>A non-metric multidimensional scaling of English soccer teams. The total number of games ever played between all teams is calculated. From this, a distance matrix is determiend that is used to perform the NMDS. 
Closeness in 2D space reprents how similar two teams are with resepect to their historical opponents. The outcome is expected but interesting nonetheless. The cluster in  the bottom left are several teams that went defunct.</p>
