<h1> Test Cricket - First Innings Scores </h1>

<br>
<p>I collected Test Match cricket data from <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/">cricinfo</a>.  Here I'm looking at three plots of first innings runs totals. These data are from 1877 - 2015 and include every game played everywhere in the world.  First, we can see that scoring a lot of runs in the first innings doesn't necessarily distinguish a team's likelihood of winning from drawing (at least historically averaged over all teams and locations), but not scoring many runs does increase a team's likelihood of losing.</p>

<p>Next, two plots that show that whilst there is not trend for first innings run totals to be increasing over time, there is a trend very recently for run rates to increase.</p>
